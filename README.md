This was work I did to archive media from a private DM group I created to share art/design inspiration. There's a lot of random scripts to manipulate the files that were downloaded. It listens to the HTTP requests and saves the media that it receives from those requests. Videos had to be handled in a separate way.

I wrote the code a few months ago from when I am writing this, so I don't remember exactly what it does. I just wanted to put it in GitHub.
